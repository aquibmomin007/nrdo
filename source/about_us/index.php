            <div class="p-column"><p>As Cancer, End Stage Renal Diseases (ESRD), Stroke and Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI) are major causes of morbidity and mortality in Singapore, the Ministry of Health (MOH) set up the former National Disease Registries Office in 2001 to manage information collection on these conditions for policy formulation and programme planning.</p>
            <p>In 2002, the National Disease Registries Office was transferred to the Research and Strategic Planning Division of the Health Promotion Board.</p>
            <p>Of the four disease registries, three are historical having been established in various institutions. The Cancer Registry was residing in National University of Singapore, while the ESRD Registry was managed by Singapore General Hospital. The AMI Registry was managed by MOH and then the Singapore Cardiac Data Bank before handed over to NRDO in April 2007. The Stroke Registry was the only new registry established by National Disease Registries Office in 2001.</p></div>

            <h2>Registry Operations</h2>
            <p>The National Registry of Diseases Office (NRDO) functions as an agent appointed by the Ministry of Health (MOH) to manage the registry operations. The Healthcare Performance Group of MOH performs the following functions in relation to NRDO:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Provides guidance on operation management</li>
                <li>Offers professional advice and oversees communication with the various agencies and hospitals</li>
                <li>Provides policy clearance on matters concerning protection, confidentiality, usage and release of data.<br />The operations of the disease registries include:</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Data Collection & Entry</h3>
            <p>Data collection and entry are carried out by the registry coordinators under the supervision of the Field Administrator. New cases are identified by NRDO through various sources including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Notifications by healthcare professionals
                <li>Hospital data for cases admitted to hospitals
                <li>Pathology and laboratory reports</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Based on the lists of likely new cases, the registry coordinators would verify and extract relevant information from the medical records or electronic database in the institutions before entering the data into the National Dis</p>

            <h3>Data Management, Data Analysis and Reporting</h3>
            <p>A team of data management staff worked with the vendor to develop the National Disease Registry System to capture data from various sources. This team not only manages the database to ensure that all data collected for the registries have been validated and are properly anonymised, but also extracts data for analysis and reporting.</p>
            <p>The team of epidemiologists and biostatistician analyses the data and generates reports for MOH on a regular basis. The analysis is performed on anonymised data only and the reports contain aggregate data and trends on incidence, prevalence and mortality of the disease covered by the particular registry.</p>

            <h3>Quality Assurance</h3>
            <p>The team of quality assurance executives ensures that requests for data go through the proper level of approval and data is being released according to the guidelines of the National Registry of Diseases Act. In addition, the team develops quality assurance policies and processes together with the registry staff in order to ensure registry output of the highest standards. The executives also perform regular audits of the sites and systems, analyse audit data and present the results in a timely and succinct manner to the management of Health Promotion Board (HPB). External audits are conducted by vendors contracted by HPB.</p>

            <h3>Registry Committees</h3>
            <p>For each registry, Ministry of Health (MOH) appoints a registry committee which comprises clinicians and epidemiologists from various public and private healthcare sectors. The roles of the registry committees are to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Provide professional support to National Registry of Diseases Office (NRDO)
                <li>Promote and facilitate submission of relevant data to NRDO by healthcare professionals and institutions</li>
                <li>Advise on the production of annual registry report<</li>
                <li>Ensure reports required by MOH are submitted timely and in appropriate format</li>
                <li>Advise and participate in the development and enhancement of the registry system</li>
                <li>Promote the use of the registry.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>NRDO Organisational Chart</h3>
            <p>As of November 2007, NRDO is made up of four teams that report to the Head of Department, namely,</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Registry Operations</li>
                <li>Epidemiology and Biostatistics</li>
                <li>Data Management</li>
                <li>Quality Assurance</li>
            </ul>
